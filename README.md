## Description

Welcome to Sequelize, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library designed for Node.js, facilitating smooth interactions with SQL databases. This project harnesses the capabilities of Sequelize to simplify database operations, making it easier for developers to work with relational databases using JavaScript.


## Features

1. Object-Relational Mapping
Sequelize provides a seamless bridge between your JavaScript application and SQL databases, allowing you to interact with the database using JavaScript objects instead of raw SQL queries. This abstraction simplifies database operations and enhances code readability.

2. Database Abstraction
With Sequelize, you can work with various SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL, without having to write database-specific code. This flexibility enables you to switch between databases effortlessly, adapting to the specific needs of your project.

3. Model Definitions
Define your data models using JavaScript classes, representing tables in your database. Sequelize translates these models into database tables, streamlining the creation and management of your database schema.

4. Migration Support
Sequelize supports database migrations, allowing you to version control your database schema changes. This feature is crucial for managing database evolution in a collaborative development environment.

## Getting Started
To start using Sequelize, follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation. Create your models, define associations, and seamlessly interact with your database using JavaScript.
